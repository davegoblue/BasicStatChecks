## BasicStatChecks  
This is a simple repository for some basic statistic checking.  Created mostly since the other directory was becoming too messy.  

* Chi-squared compared to N(0,1) - showing that if x ~ N(0,1) then x^2 ~ chi-squared(df=1)
* One-way ANOVA compared with multivariate regression using dummy variables
