## BasicStatChecks  
This is a simple repository for some basic statistic checking.  Created mostly since the other directory was becoming too messy.  

* Condensed Course Notes from UvA Inferential Statistics  
* One-way ANOVA compared with multivariate regression using dummy variables  
* Chi-squared calculations from a 3x3 frame, including Pearson residuals, standardized residuals, and Cramer's V (outputs include html, pdf, and md; Rmd file also uploaded)  
* Chi-squared compared to N(0,1) - showing that if x ~ N(0,1) then x^2 ~ chi-squared(df=1)  
* Bias in Population Estimates for Variance and Standard Deviation from a Sample, using Sample and Population Methods; also an example of using Acrobat to convert a local html to a PDF
